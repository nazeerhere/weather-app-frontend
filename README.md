**Getting Started**

To get this app up and running two repos will be needed. This one is the first, the frontend. The backend is the second part here: https://github.com/nazeerhere/Deft-weather-app

*Installation & Setup*
- All these commands will be run from the terminal

1. Copy the link from the green "Code" button above the readme on Github.
2. In the same folder you're using to hold the backend, use the link you've copied to run the command `git clone {paste url here}`
3. `cd` into the folder, and run the command `npm i`
4. Once the download finishes start the app with `npm start`
5. Before using the page setup and launch the backend here: https://github.com/nazeerhere/Deft-weather-app

**Running The App**

Once the back and frontends are setup, you are now ready to check city weather forcast. In the input bar under "Select Location" type the name city you wish to see (a list of cities used to test the api will be included: Chicago, Boston, New Yory, Los Angeles, and Houston) The app will return three cards displaying the forcast for the next few days.
